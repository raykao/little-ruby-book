# Little Ruby Book

## Why write a ruby book

This book is meant to be a small teaching aid at our [office](http://peopleandcode.com), and to make notes on the nitty gritty stuff that I'll never remember.  In truth it's away for me to test how much I actually know, and how well I know it.

At work we've been building [LearnToronto.org](http://learntoronto.org) with the express purpose of teaching technology and this is in prep for one of our ruby modules.
